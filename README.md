See [this page](https://gondolindrim.github.io/AcheronDocs/hammerhead/intro.html) for the Hammerhead documentation.

## Introduction

The Hammerhead is named after the SharkPCB; in order to differentiate Hammerhead (which features a staggered layout) from the Shark (which features an ortho layout), I renamed the staggered version like so.

This PCB was born as a replacement PCB for an AMJ40 keyboard I have. I bought it from a user on r/mechmarket for a fairly cheap price, since the stock kit PCB was not working due to that previous owner using a Dremel tool and breaking a few traces on the PCB. After fixing the stock PCB it did work for three years, and I set myself to devise another PCB for it. As such, Hammerhead is fully compatible with the AMJ40 case.
